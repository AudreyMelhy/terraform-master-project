Whether it's good or bad to delete replicated objects depends on your specific use case and requirements. Here are some considerations to help you determine the best approach:

Data Retention Policies: Consider your organization's data retention policies. Some organizations may have requirements to retain data for a certain period before deletion, while others may need to delete data promptly to comply with regulations such as GDPR.
Disaster Recovery: Deleting replicated objects may impact your disaster recovery strategy. If the source data is accidentally deleted or corrupted, having replicated copies provides redundancy and enables recovery. However, if the source data is compromised, you may want to ensure that the replication process does not immediately delete the replicated copies.
Cost Considerations: Storing replicated objects in multiple locations can incur additional storage costs. If you have strict budget constraints, deleting replicated objects that are no longer needed may help optimize costs.
Data Synchronization: Ensure that the replication process is synchronized and reliable before considering deleting replicated objects. Deleting objects prematurely may lead to data loss if the replication process is not properly configured or if there are synchronization issues.
Audit and Compliance: Consider audit and compliance requirements. Deleting replicated objects should be done in compliance with relevant regulations and industry standards. Ensure that proper audit trails and logging mechanisms are in place to track deletions.
In summary, whether it's good or bad to delete replicated objects depends on factors such as data retention policies, disaster recovery needs, cost considerations, data synchronization reliability, and compliance requirements. It's essential to evaluate these factors carefully and implement deletion policies that align with your organization's goals and best practices.
